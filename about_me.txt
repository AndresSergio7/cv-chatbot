My name is Sergio Valle. I used to work in the operations industry, specifically in agriculture, where I led various operational projects. Most of these projects involved launching new operations, from implementing machinery to setting up entire production facilities. I really enjoyed that chapter of my life, but I always felt a strong curiosity for artificial intelligence. That curiosity eventually led me to make the decision to pursue a career in AI. I’m passionate about applying AI to solve real-world business challenges.

In my free time, I love going to the beach and enjoying the sun. Sometimes I surf a little—if the swell is good and not too big. I'm not great at it yet, but I'm improving. My goal is to get really good one day, but for now, I’m enjoying the journey and having fun with the process.

I also enjoy watching soccer and playing padel. Both sports keep me active and bring me a lot of joy.

Lately, I’ve been trying to read more. I didn’t enjoy reading much at first, but I’ve started to really appreciate it. One book that has had a big impact on me is The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO. It helped me make some meaningful decisions in my life.

I was born in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, where my father is from. However, I’ve spent most of my life in Guatemala City, Guatemala, where I’ve built amazing friendships and deep connections. Currently, I live in Barcelona, and I’m truly inspired by the innovation and startup ecosystem here. The support from the Catalan government for entrepreneurship has opened my eyes to the vast potential Europe has to offer.

When it comes to food, my favorite is definitely a simple salami pizza. Nothing fancy—just a good, classic Italian pizza.

Looking ahead, I see myself as a role model for my family, friends, and colleagues. I want to be someone who has a positive impact on everyone I interact with—personally and professionally.
