My name is Sergio Valle. I used to work in the operations industry, specifically in agriculture, where I led various operational projects. Most of these projects involved launching new operations, from implementing machinery to setting up entire production facilities. I really enjoyed that chapter of my life, but I always felt a strong curiosity for artificial intelligence. That curiosity eventually led me to make the decision to pursue a career in AI. I’m passionate about applying AI to solve real-world business challenges.

At Nordic, I worked on several projects as a Project Manager. My most significant accomplishment was leading the development of a new fertilizer plant. When the project began, the only existing asset was the warehouse structure. I was responsible for overseeing the entire process, including selecting the right suppliers, assembling the engineering team, and managing the construction.

It was a major challenge, especially since my background is primarily in business rather than engineering. However, I made a strong effort to understand the technical aspects involved and successfully led the project to completion. Given its scale a million-dollar investment it was a high-responsibility role that significantly contributed to my professional growth.

At Beder, I gained valuable insight into the technical side of companies. I deepened my understanding of how APIs work and learned firsthand how startups operate. The experience helped me realize how challenging it can be to build a business from the ground up, and how crucial the team is in turning an idea into a reality. The people you work with truly become the driving force behind success.

In my free time, I love going to the beach and enjoying the sun. Sometimes I surf a little if the swell is good and not too big. I'm not great at it yet, but I'm improving. My goal is to get really good one day, but for now, I’m enjoying the journey and having fun with the process.

I also enjoy watching soccer and playing padel. Both sports keep me active and bring me a lot of joy.

Lately, I’ve been trying to read more. I didn’t enjoy reading much at first, but I’ve started to really appreciate it. One book that has had a big impact on me is The Saint, the Surfer, and the CEO. It helped me make some meaningful decisions in my life.

I was born in Tegucigalpa, the capital of Honduras, where my father is from. However, my mom is from Guatemala so I’ve spent most of my life in Guatemala City, Guatemala, where I’ve built amazing friendships and deep connections. Currently, I live in Barcelona, and I’m truly inspired by the innovation and startup ecosystem here. The support from the Catalan government for entrepreneurship has opened my eyes to the vast potential Europe has to offer.

When it comes to food, my favorite is definitely a simple salami pizza. Nothing fancy—just a good, classic Italian pizza.

Looking ahead, I see myself as a role model for my family, friends, and colleagues. I want to be someone who has a positive impact on everyone I interact with—personally and professionally.
